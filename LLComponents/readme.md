You are given the head of a linked list containing unique integer values and an integer array nums that is a subset of the linked list values.

Return the number of connected components in nums where two values are connected if they appear consecutively in the linked list.

Input: head = [0,1,2,3], nums = [0,1,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: 0 and 1 are connected, so [0, 1] and [3] are the two connected components.
